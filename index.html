            Gained fluency in Javascript by creating interactive websites and web applications. I got hands-on experience with JavaScript and jQuery, the browser, and the DOM. I learned to consume data from third-party APIs and persist user input using a back-end-as-a-service provider.

            Learned basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through hands-on projects and
            was able to develop full-functioning websites and applications. I went on to
            use these skills at my full time job to build and contribute to custom web appliations and API integrations for client projects. <br> <br>

I completed three marketing internships prior to graduation which exposed me to SEO marketing, B2B sales, and CRM management practices. As a regular volunteer at The Urban Food Project I worked directly with experienced urban farmers and sustainbility activists to maintain and grow local farms and greenhouses. -->
