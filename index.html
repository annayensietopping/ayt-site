          Learned basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through hands-on projects and
          was able to develop full-functioning websites and applications. I went on to

          Creativity and attention to detail were very important while writing,
          shooting, and designing all of the original content that I shared on
          client Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn accounts. Using
          engagement data, analytics, and Facebook Ads Manager I tracked results
          and strategized new ways to gain followers and increase content
          viewership.

          Continuing my education outside of the classroom shaped my college experience. I completed three marketing internships prior to graduation which exposed me to SEO marketing, B2B sales, and CRM management practices. As a regular volunteer at The Urban Food Project I worked directly with experienced urban farmers and sustainbility activists to maintain and grow local farms and greenhouses.
