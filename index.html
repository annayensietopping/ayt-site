            <div class="time"><i>Oct 2018 - present</i></div>
          </div>
          Responsible for 73 client accounts, I maintain relationships by
          coordinating hardware installations, managing web development
          projects, and regularly communicating with clients to ensure all needs
          are met. I work directly with our team of engineers and developers to
          create customized solutions for high profile clients, including
          Brookfield Place, JuicePress, Equinox, and New York University.

          Learned basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through hands-on projects and
          was able to develop an interactive, responsive website. I went on to
          use these skills at my full time job to build and contribute to custom
          HTML and web appliations for clients.

          Creativity and attention to detail were very important while writing,
          shooting, and designing all of the original content that I shared on
          client Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn accounts. Using
          engagement data, analytics, and Facebook Ads Manager I tracked results
          and strategized new ways to gain followers and increase content
          viewership.

          Responding to customer emails, planning marketing events, and managing
          over $10,000 of yearly donations were only a few of my responsibilties
          in this role. I oversaw all brand development and managed all social
          media accounts and raised instagram engagement by 23% by creating
          consistent and engaging content. I also assisted in the execution of
          five new product campaigns and a complete overhaul of the customer
          loyalty program. My favorite flavor of ice cream is Brownie Batter.
