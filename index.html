              I am currently working as an Account Manager at Zero-In Digital
              Signage in the Flatiron district in Manhattan. I manage 73
              accounts ranging from small local banks to national restaurant
              chains like Melt Shop, The Little Beet and Juice Press. My
              favorite thing about my work is building relationships with my
              clients and seeing firsthand how our solutions impact their
              business.

              This spring I completed the Front End Web Development part-time
              class at General Assembly. In this course I built my own
              responsive and interactive website using HTML, CSS, and
              JavaScript.

              In the past, I worked as the Marketing Coordinator for J.P. Licks
              Homemade Ice Cream and Coffee Caf√©. In this role, I was responding
              to customer emails, managing events and donations and running all
              social media accounts. Follow J.P. Licks on Instagram, Twitter,
              and Facebook. My favorite flavor of ice cream is Brownie Batter.
