Metter Media: Social Media Content for Corporate Clients

Created in Adobe Photoshop  CC  2018 

 
#TeamICNE is a monthly staff spotlight campaign that provides a short profile on a different employee each month. I worked directly with the client to get in touch with each staff member and conduct a short phone interview to learn more about them and write a short social media post sharing more about their role at the company and their lives outside of work. This campaign was a great way to show off my client’s personality while also giving our followers an in-depth look at the insurance professionals on my client’s staff.

I like to create simple infographics using the colors and branding for my clients. This is a simple three tip template that can be used for any season or subject matter. I believe that effective content is able to share useful information while also directing followers back to my client’s website.

This client’s blog is filled with helpful information and tips for making the most of your insurance and this post was designed to share a small tip to give our followers a taste of what kind of content they will find on the blog. The #ICNETips campaign was a great way to keep our content informative and productive, while also drawing attention to our blogs.

There is beauty in simplicity — one the best ways to provide a little #MondayMotivation to your followers is with a simple quote. I love using this template a few times a month to share a positive and inspiring message with our followers. Easy to make and easy to share!

I planned a Facebook giveaway with this client to raise engagement and grow our followers. I spoke with the client to decide what we were going to give away and then reviewed the entries to select our winners. We also used Facebook Ads Manager to give this post an extra paid boost, because we wanted as many entries as possible.


I created a successful #ThrowbackThursday campaign for this client to show off their deep roots within the community that they serve. I met with the client and they shared several old photos of their original offices and insurance teams, it was amazing to be able to share this history with our followers. A great way to engage with hyper-local communities and show that my client is very established in their industry.



J.P. Licks Social Media

In July of 2017, J.P. Licks launched their original Nano Black charcoal soft serve! This was an incredible social media opportunity and the flavor went viral. I made sure to post a lot of photos of the crazy cones that our scoopers were making in the stores, as well as reposting photos from happy customers. This product was not only delicious — but it’s unique color sold itself.

J.P. Licks is a famous name in Boston, which is why we won so many awards and accolades! I feel that it is very important to thank your customers, followers and long-time fans in these situations because the brand wouldn’t be where it is today without the support of their customers. #CustomerAppreciation

One of the greatest things about J.P. Licks is their rotating monthly flavor menu. This is what makes the brand unique, fun and memorable. These flavors are often strange and always delicious, so as the social media manager, I made sure to show off the new flavors at the start of every month. Here is a photo of the December flavors, which were a personal favorite of mine.

 Vince, the founder, and owner of J.P. Licks had a vision of a weekly #MysteryPhoto social media contest. I took this on as my own project and photographed and outlined a schedule for the mystery photos. I worked directly with Vince to curate this collection and although it was difficult to shoot and edit with my limited resources, we made it work for almost six months. Here is one of my favorite of the mystery photos that was also a top scoring post in terms of engagement and impressions.
